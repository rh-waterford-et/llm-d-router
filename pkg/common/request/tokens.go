// CapSingleToken rewrites body into a synthetic, non-streaming,
// single-output-token prefill or encode request. It returns the map
// the caps were written into: sampling_params for the generate API, body itself
// otherwise. The generate API also expects transfer params in that map, so a
// caller adding them needs no second lookup.
//
// The caps to rewrite come from APIType.tokenLimitFields, so each API's output
// caps are named in one place. min_tokens is a floor rather than a cap, so it is
// stripped instead of capped: it defaults to 0 in vLLM, so removing it keeps
// min_tokens <= max_tokens=1 without raising the floor above the cap (vLLM's
// SamplingParams rejects min_tokens > max_tokens).
//
// body is rewritten in place, so the caller passes its own copy. A one-level
// copy is enough: the generate sampling_params is always replaced with a map
// body owns, so the rewrite never reaches a nested map the body was cloned from.
